# A story about git

Once, there was a group of developers, happily pushing and pulling to and from the main branch. While this caused some issues when working on the same file simultaneously, it wasn't that big of a problem, as there were only three of them, so chances of them introducing conflicts were pretty low.

One day, however, they started to discover the magic of branches. This enabled them to have different versions, or timelines of their project and test out their changes and tweaks completely independent from everybody else's changes. So, they started to adopt this feature and created new branches for their features, merging them with the main branch once their feature was complete. Sure, when they learned about branches, there was an old text carved into the wall in an arcane language, saying _Beware of merge conflicts_, but the group has seen other, much more scary texts in the past, such as C++ Templates and so, they weren't too intimidated by this.
